# tiny_vm
A tiny virtual machine interpreter for Quack programs

## Work in progress

This is intended to become the core of an interpreter for the Winter 2022
offering of CIS 461/561 compiler construction course at University of Oregon, 
if I can ready it in time. 

## How to use asm_generator

Simply run "python asm_generator"<br />
Then run "python assemble.py unit_tests/sample.asm sample.json"<br />
If you have tiny_vm, then run it at last.
